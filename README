TODO
====

- Clean up code. For example there is no need to set default values in the
  ImageHandle class AND in the main program.
- Extend the ImageHandle class. Add some methods for setting single class
  variables. This can be used to clean up the code (directly set a single
  class variable if a matching argument is found).


BUGS
====

There are no known bugs. If you find one please drop me a line at
<rw AT digigeek DOT net> describing the bug. Patches are also appreciated.


NOTES
